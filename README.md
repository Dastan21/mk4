## _I want it to be mp4_

mk4 is a Python 3 script to convert mkv videos into mp4, and burning subtitles into the mp4 output. You can choose the font and the size of the subtitles in the config file.

## Usage
```sh
mk4.py <file.mkv | directory> [<file.mkv | directory> ...]
```

OR

```sh
mk4.py --help
```

## Prerequisites
You only need to have ffmpeg installed in your system.

## To-Do

- Deal with multiples audio/subtitles tracks
- Improve the stdout to make it more dynamic
- The `--help` flag

Please enjoy !!
